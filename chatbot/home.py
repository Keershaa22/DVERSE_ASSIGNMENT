**Gedee Car Museum** is the only classic car museum of its kind in South India, located in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. 
It has an impressive collection of more than 100 vintage cars, each with a history or a unique technology.

The cars are a private collection of **G D Naidu Charities**, a social trust founded by (late) Sri. G D Naidu. 
Like his father, Sri. G D Gopal, who is also an avid auto enthusiast, purchased and collected several cars, 
especially those that had unique mechanical features or the ones that had significantly influenced the evolution of the automobile.
