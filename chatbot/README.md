About the Project :

The GD Car Museum Chatbot is an interactive web-based assistant designed to provide visitors with quick and easy access to information about the Gedee Car Museum. The chatbot allows users to inquire about the museum's history, collections, guided tours, ticket prices, accessibility, and more. It enhances user experience by providing structured responses to frequently asked questions.

Tech Stack Used :

Streamlit: For building the web application and chatbot interface.

Python: The core programming language for the backend logic.

spaCy: For natural language processing and query understanding.

The chatbot leverages spaCy NLP to analyze user queries and fetch relevant information from a pre-defined JSON database containing museum details. The home page provides an overview of the museum along with an image, while the chatbot page enables visitors to ask questions in a user-friendly manner. The chatbot is designed to improve visitor engagement by offering instant responses related to museum facilities, timings, ticket prices, and special exhibits.
