About the Project

The Hand Detection and Gesture Recognition project is an advanced computer vision application that detects hands, tracks their movement, identifies fingers, and recognizes gestures in real time. This project enables interaction with digital interfaces through hand movements, making it useful for various applications like sign language interpretation, virtual controls, and human-computer interaction.

Tech Stack Used
Python: Core programming language for implementing the project.
OpenCV: For image processing and real-time hand tracking.
MediaPipe: For efficient hand landmark detection.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Machine Learning: Used for gesture classification and recognition.

Project Summary

The project consists of multiple components working together:

Hand Detection: Identifies and localizes hands in a given frame.

Hand Tracking: Continuously follows hand movement in real time.

Finger Detection: Determines the number of raised fingers.

Gesture Recognition: Analyzes finger positions to interpret specific gestures.

Main Application: Integrates all modules to provide a functional interface for gesture-based interaction.

This project enhances interactive experiences by enabling seamless communication between users and digital systems using hand gestures.
